## Databases
A **database** is a file / program that stores data.

A CSV is considered a **flat-file database**.

**relational databases** are programs that store data.
Some examples are **Oracle**, **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**.

## Canonicalization
Means to format all of your data in some standard way.

## Massaging Data
Doing some mutation to the data that doesn’t change it’s meaning but, canonicalizes it.

## Database Normalization
To separate data into tables that are related to each other.

## Primary and Foreign keys
### Primary key
Used to uniquely identify a piece of data. (e.g. ID)

### Foreign key
A particular column that references a primary key in another table.

## Working with SQLite
Run the command `sqlite3` to start the program.

To start `csv` mode run:
```
.mode csv
```

To load a `csv` file into a table run:
```
.import 'FILENAME' TABLENAME
```

To show the structure / schema of the database run:
```
.schema
```

## Operations (CRUD)
- Create (Insert)
- Read (Select)

- Delete

## Functions
- AVG
- COUNT
- DISTINCT
- LOWER
- MAX
- MIN
- UPPER

## Clauses
- WHERE
- LIKE

## SELECT
```sql
SELECT column FROM table;
SELECT column column2 FROM table;
SELECT * FROM table;
```

### WHERE
```sql
SELECT title FROM shows WHERE title = "The Office";
```
**output**:
"The Office"
"The Office"
"The Office"

### ORDER BY
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT(UPPER(title)) FROM shows ORDER BY UPPER(title);
```
**output**:
FRIENDS
"FRIENDS "
"FRIENDS ETC."
OFFICE
"SHERLOCKS; FRIENDS "
"THE OFFICE"
"THE OFFICE "

### GROUP BY
Groups identical titles together
```sql
SELECT UPPER(title), COUNT(title) FROM shows GROUP BY UPPER(title);
```
**output**:
FRIENDS,26
"FRIENDS ",1
"FRIENDS ETC.",2
OFFICE,1
"SHERLOCKS; FRIENDS ",1
"THE OFFICE",23
"THE OFFICE ",3

### DESC / ASC
```sql
SELECT UPPER(title), COUNT(title) FROM shows GROUP BY UPPER(title) ORDER BY COUNT(title) DESC;
```
**output**:
FRIENDS,26
"THE OFFICE",23
"THE OFFICE ",3
"FRIENDS ETC.",2
"SHERLOCKS; FRIENDS ",1
OFFICE,1
"FRIENDS ",1

### LIMIT
```sql
SELECT UPPER(title), COUNT(title) FROM shows GROUP BY UPPER(title) ORDER BY COUNT(title) DESC LIMIT 3;
```
**output**:
FRIENDS,26
"THE OFFICE",23
"THE OFFICE ",3

### TRIM
```sql
SELECT UPPER(TRIM(title)), COUNT(title) FROM shows GROUP BY UPPER(TRIM(title)) ORDER BY COUNT(title) DESC;
```
**output**:
FRIENDS,27
"THE OFFICE",26
"FRIENDS ETC.",2
"SHERLOCKS; FRIENDS",1
OFFICE,1

### Saving
```
.save FILENAME.db
```

## INSERT
```sql
INSERT INTO shows (Timestamp, title, genres) VALUES("now", "The Muppet Show", "Comedy, Musical");
SELECT * FROM shows WHERE title LIKE "%muppet%";
```
**output**:  now,"The Muppet Show","Comedy, Musical"

## UPDATE
```sql
UPDATE shows SET genres = "Comedy, Musical, Drama" WHERE title = "The Muppet Show";
SELECT * FROM shows WHERE title LIKE "%muppet%";
```
**output**: now,"The Muppet Show","Comedy, Musical, Drama"

## Delete
```sql
DELETE FROM shows WHERE title LIKE "%Friends%";
SELECT COUNT(title) FROM shows WHERE title LIKE "%Friends%";
```
**output**: 0

## Main Data Types
- BLOB (Binary Large Object)
- INTEGER
- NUMERIC (Number-like)
- REAL (float)
- TEXT

## Specifications
- NOT NULL (A column cannot be null)
- UNIQUE (A column must be unique)

## Nested Queries
```sql
SELECT title FROM shows WHERE id IN (SELECT show_id FROM genres WHERE genre = "Comedy");

SELECT title FROM shows WHERE id IN (SELECT show_id FROM stars WHERE person_id = (SELECT id FROM people WHERE name = "Steve Carell"));
```

## JOIN
Joins tables together.

```sql
SELECT title FROM people
	JOIN stars ON people.id = stars.person_id
	JOIN shows ON stars.show_id = shows.id
	WHERE name = "Steve Carell";
```

## Indexes
```sql
CREATE INDEX name ON table (column);
```

## Using IN and ‘=’
If we used `=`  we would be checking if `id` is equal to one particular `person_id`. So if there were multiple values returned by this query, we would only get the first one.
```sql
SELECT name FROM people WHERE id IN (SELECT person_id FROM stars WHERE show_id = 386676);
```
**output**:
name
Angela Kinsey

```sql
SELECT name FROM people WHERE id IN (SELECT person_id FROM stars WHERE show_id = 386676);
```
**output**:
name
Steve Carell
Jenna Fischer
Rainn Wilson
John Krasinski
Angela Kinsey
Leslie David Baker
Brian Baumgartner
