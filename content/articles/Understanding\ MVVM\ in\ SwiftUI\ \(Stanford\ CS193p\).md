MVVM is a design paradigm that stands for stands for *Model-View-ViewModel*.

### Model

- It is completely UI independent (simple swift files)
- Contains the **data** + **logic**

### View

- A reflection of the current state of the model
- Declarative (the view is determined by what `body` returns)

### ViewModel

- Binds the View to the Model so that changes in the model cause the view to get rebuilt
- Example: gets data from a SQL database and puts it into an array
- It constantly looks for changes in the model and publishes 'to everyone' that something has changed
- Can modify the model
