Mandarin Chinese (普通话) has always fascinated me and learning it has been a long-standing aspiration of mine. In this article, I'll introduce you to several tools I use alongside Anki to create visually appealing flashcards for Mandarin Chinese.

### Anki

Anki is an open-source flashcard program that uses spaced repetition, a learning technique that increases intervals of time between reviews of previously learned material.

### Pretiffy

Anki's note types consist of two HTML files (one for the front and one for the back of the card) along with a CSS file. To enhance the appearance and modernize our cards, we can utilize a template named **[prettify](https://github.com/pranavdeshai/anki-prettify)**.

Naturally, we have the freedom to make templates suit our individual preferences, such as opting for centered text or incorporating additional buttons. I have done exactly that, and you can access my customized template on my GitHub repository, named [NeoMnemo](https://github.com/riceset/NeoMnemo) (access it from the `mandarin` branch!)

###  Pinyin

After experimenting with numerous plugins for adding pinyin to Chinese characters, the one I ultimately chose was [Pinyin on top of Hanzi](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/417709332). This plugin generates pinyin readings and places them within HTML ruby tags, resulting in a visually stunning result.

### Audio

I  currently use Google Translate's voice into [AwesomeTTS](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1436550454) for generating audio files for my sentences.
